        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am a father of three wonderful children, two of which are fraternal twins. They keep me and my wife busy. For a long time I danced around the idea of learning how to code. Played around with some blockchain code here and there. Only once I had seen the ad for Lambda School did I actually think it would be possible with my schedule and current responsibilities to learn how to code. But lo' and behold I am nearly a month in to the program as of writing this and I can honestly say that I wouldn't have been able to even put this portfolio page together before I started this course in web development. I look forward to the future and what I will learn while enrolled at Lambda School.</p>
